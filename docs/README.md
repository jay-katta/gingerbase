Build and Install
-----------------

    Wok:
    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

    Ginger Base:
    $ cd plugins/gingerbasae

    $ ./autogen.sh --system

    $ make
    $ sudo make install   # Optional if running from the source tree

Run
---

    $ systemctl start wokd

Test
----

    $ cd plugins/gingerbase
    $ make check-local # check for i18n and formatting errors
    $ sudo make check

After all tests are executed, a summary will be displayed containing any
 errors/failures which might have occurred.

Usage
-----

Connect your browser to https://localhost:8001.
Once logged in you could see host tab which provides the gingerbase functionality.

Wok uses PAM to authenticate users so you can log in with the same username
and password that you would use to log in to the machine itself.

Ginger Base Host tab provides the base host functionality like system information,
 system statistics, software updates, repositories and debug reports functionality.

Also Ginger Base provides shutdown, re-start and connect options.
